        Karachi, often referred to as the "City of Lights," is the bustling metropolis and economic hub of Pakistan.

        industry, and finance. Its skyline is adorned with modern skyscrapers, reflecting the city's rapid urbanization
        and economic significance.</p>
    <p>What truly sets Karachi apart is its rich tapestry of cultural diversity. The city is home to people from various
        ethnic backgrounds, including Urdu-speaking Muhajirs, Sindhis, Punjabis, Pashtuns, and Baloch, creating a unique
        mosaic of traditions and languages. The streets of Karachi come alive with a kaleidoscope of colors, sounds, and
